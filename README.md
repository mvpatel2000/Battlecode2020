# smite
This is the [Battlecode 2020](https://battlecode.org) repository of team smite. We placed second in the final tournament.

## Strategy Report
Our strategy report is coming soon.

## To Run
Clone the [Battlecode 2020 Scaffold](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode20-scaffold), install the JDK for Java 8 and run `./gradlew build` in the scaffold directory.

Then, clone this repository, and copy over the `src/` folder into the scaffold. To run games, open the client (a `client/` folder will appear once the `build` command has been run), and select the bots you wish to run. All bots can be found in the `src/` directory:

* `sprint/` was our submission for the Sprint tournament. We placed 3rd/4th (single elimination).
* `seeding2/` was our submissions for the Seeding tournament. We placed 1st.
* `quail/` is not a copy of our submission for the Qualifying tournament, despite the commit message. It appears we don't have a copy currently in the directory, but [this folder from an earlier commit](https://github.com/mvpatel2000/Battlecode2020/tree/2eae1955bdb0ea8d9c4cc90e9a8a84013ea2d948/src/poseidon) was our submission.
* `qual/` was our Final tournament submission. Apologies for the misleading name.

The other folders are other versions which we copied for testing purposes. `hades/` beats our final submission far more often than it should. So does `quail/`.

## Previous Years
* [2019 submission](https://github.com/mvpatel2000/Battlecode2019) (1st)
